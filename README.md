## Assignment Objective

The aim of this assignment is to reflect on and demonstrate the development of entrepreneurial competencies through the lens of the societal challenge you focused on combined with the insights from guest lectures and podcasts, with a focus on the three key competences in the EntreComp Framework: Ideas and Opportunities, Resources, Into Action. This assignment connects the **team-based challenge work** with your **personal development** in the three competence areas: Ideas & Opportunities, Resources, Into Action, by comparing the insights collected from the entrepreneurs featured in **guest lectures and podcasts** with your own experiences, thus showing how theory and practice intersect.

## Part 1: Challenge Reflection

This part is mostly about ideas and opportunities. You can use about 500 words, and visuals are allowed.

- Select one **opportunity** your team explored during the Smart City challenge.
- In your own words, explain:
  - What unmet need or problem was identified?
  - Why you personally found it meaningful or relevant?
  - Which ideation tools you used and how they shape the opportunity?
- **Connection to practice**: Refer to **at least three** insights from three different guest lectures or podcasts that inspired how to further develop your competences in Ideation and Opportunity Discovery. Explain how this could strengthen or change the approach used by your team in the challenge

## Part 2: Resource Reflection

This part is mostly about resources. You can use about 400 words, and a table or a matrix allowed.

- Analyze the **resources** needed to move this opportunity forward:
  - Human capital (skills/expertise).
  - Social capital (partners, networks, stakeholders).
  - Physical/financial resources (prototyping, funding, tech).
- Compare these to the resources your team currently has.
- Where do you personally see yourself contributing most strongly?
- **Connection to practice**: Reflect on how one entrepreneur/guest described mobilizing resources (e.g. leveraging networks, bootstrapping, partnerships). How does this relate to your own analysis?

## Part 3: Action Reflection

This part is mostly about intro action. You can use about 400 words, and a table or a matrix allowed.

- Reflect on your **actions and behaviors** during the course:
  - How did you deal with **uncertainty** in the ideation process?
  - Which choices or behaviors had the most impact on your team’s progress?
  - How did you communicate/pitch your ideas to others, and what feedback did you receive?
- Compare your own experience with how one entrepreneur from the podcasts or lectures described acting under uncertainty, making decisions, or pitching. Refer to at least two specific insights collected from two different guest lectures and/or podcasts.

## Part 4: Personal Development Plan

This part is about your self reflection. You can use about 400 words, and use a bullet-point format.

- Based on the 7 course learning objectives, **identify two entrepreneurial competences** you want to strengthen further.
- Explain why you chose them, and design **a SMART learning goal** for each.
- Suggest at least one concrete activity you will do after this course to develop each competence (e.g., join a startup team, take a design thinking MOOC, volunteer in a student board).
- **Connection to practice**: Which entrepreneur (guest or podcast) do you see as a role model for these competences? Why?

The full assignment description, resources and assessment rubric can be found [in the details document](share/details.pdf).
