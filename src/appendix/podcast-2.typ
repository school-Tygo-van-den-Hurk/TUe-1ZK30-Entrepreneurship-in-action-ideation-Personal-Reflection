#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That's the tar pit talking. It's like oh this looks like a nice pool. No one's
    no one's here, drinking at it. I'm going to I'm gonna go get a drink of water
    for this pool, right? Like no danger quicksand, this is Michael Seibel with
    Dalton Caldwell and today we're going to give advice on pivoting by discussing
    the start-up ideas.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That Founders, most often pivot into and away from, we call these ideas Has tar,
    pit ideas Dalton, explain the problem here, what's going on. So here's the deal.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's surprisingly a lot of people's ideas are surprisingly the same across
    Founders and so when we read the thousands of applications that apply every
    batch and we interview the thousands of companies, every batch that we do
    there's a lot of common ideas and specifically what were we talking about today
    is tar.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Pit ideas and will explain what that means in a moment but these are ideas that
    lots of people try. And they don't succeed and they don't pivot back out of them
    quickly enough. So it's a cause of death for many many, many, many companies
    statistically are some of these Tarpon ideas.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So so I'll put this back to you, Michael, Michael explain why we would use the
    word tar pit. What are we trying to say? What does that mean? I know you did
    some research here. Yeah, did a little bit of Google in here so a tar pit is a
    place where petroleum is kind of coming up and seeping up through the Earth and
    it tends to be a great place to find fossilized remains dinosaurs other forms of
    life and the reason why is that apparently tarpit pools resemble freshwater
    ponds.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And so animals will come across them. Think it's freshwater step in, get stuck
    because the tar is very sticky. Die. Start to decompose that smell will attract
    more animals and then you get this kind of cascading negative effect which as I
    say it out loud, describes the phenomenon in the startup world so perfectly it's
    it's not even funny.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yeah, tar pit ideas. Attract Founders to them. They sinned. They seem like good
    ideas. They seem like something people want. You know, it's ideas that are like
    very appealing and and the fact that there isn't already famous company, solving
    them already attracts.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    More Founders, do you think I'm saying? Like, it looks like you've come up with
    this, amazing original idea and the death of everyone that attempted it is hard
    to see and all you see is like a freshwater pool. You're like, oh, this is a
    wide open space across. But right below the surface.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Okay, yeah. It looks good, right? That's why it's so alluring. And so and so
    look, why are we doing this talk? Or why are we telling you this? We would love
    for this, not to happen to you. We would love to not see the tens of thousands
    of applications of people working on these really rough ideas and if you can
    manage to not fall into the tar, pit yourself, your overall odds of success.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    In your startup Journey are much higher. That's why we're talking about this
    stuff. Well let's be clear not only do these companies apply and do we interview
    them? We have funded many Tarpon, I did. So like we've seen the journey you know
    from Founders NYC and then getting stuck in this space to.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So a lot of what we do I see is we try to communicate the common Paths of
    failure so you don't follow them. And this is just another example of that.
    Let's start. So let's begin with this. The fact is most tar pit ideas. At least
    the ones we see the most in the ones weren't about today are what you would call
    consumer ideas.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Consumer means you know the customer is a consumer will talk about that in a
    second. But like let's let's dive into that Michael. Why don't you kick this
    off? What, what is a consumer idea? What is a consumer business? So this is a
    product that's being marketed to people not companies sometimes.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    These products are free and monetized with ads, social networks are extremely
    common. Sometimes these products are paid products, you know, the whole gig
    economy, I would describe as a consumer business. But, you know, it's consumer
    business because individual people use it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And it's a product that's not primarily marketed to businesses. That's where,
    you know, you're in the consumer world. Yeah. And there's some Nuance here folks
    on the internet, so we don't need to get into a semantic debate. We're just
    trying to To just go with us on this definition, just bear with us here, even if
    there's some Nuance to debate about this.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So why do founders chin tend to choose consumer idea so much? Why do they tend
    to be tarp etcetera etcetera? So yeah, why is that Michael? Why is the average
    person applying to y c applying with a consumer idea? Well, I think it starts
    with we're all consumers.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    We are all consumers and we are being marketed products, basically, our whole
    lives. And so often, when we think about the problems in our lives, or we think
    about the problems that interest us, they tend to be things that we would use,
    or we think we would use or we think our friends with use, that's a big one.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    What are others? I think that when we know stories about other Founders or about
    startups, most of the stories we know are about consumer Founders and consumer
    startups and consumer. Assesses. So you think about the hero worship of Steve
    Jobs or Mark, Zuckerberg or whatever?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And it's hard not to think about these people because they build products. We
    all use every day. Like, if you spend your time watching television and looking
    at apps and looking at your iPhone, with, for most of your waking hours, it's
    hard. Not to be thinking about consumer app ideas, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Like I get it, I get where I get where he's coming from, we rarely meet a
    Founder that's in love with Cisco or Uncle, you know, and that makes sense. Zach
    and and so I think we get told these stories as I think by default, if you're
    thinking about starting a company You by default come up with consumer ideas
    because it's what you know, it's what you think.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Every startup is as a consumer, especially if you're not as familiar with how
    the startup World works. Yeah. And this is rough. Why is this rough Michael? Why
    is it? Why is it hard doing consumer stuff? So I think there's two challenges
    here.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    I think the first challenge is people often don't understand how high the bar is
    the consumer products that they use. They don't realize how actually good they
    are and how many others existed and failed. So that's the first thing under the
    second thing.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And we should get a little bit more is that I think that timing tends to be very
    important. Oughtn't in consumer. So I think sometimes people don't realize when
    timing is helping them in a consumer business and when timing is actually
    harming them and existing incumbents can be have an almost unfair Advantage.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yeah. I think from our perspective or from my perspective reading applications,
    let's start with this calibration of what good looks like. Because again imagine
    the person applying with an idea for a consumer social network, it's unlocked,
    they found you know they believe what they're doing is like brand-new and they
    don't really know.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Know what the bar is. Let's talk about the bar quickly for something. Let's talk
    about Google or throw that one out really quickly. Yep. I was in college when
    Google came out and It had incredible word-of-mouth you had to manually have
    heard of it on the internet somewhere.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    You think I've heard of it from slashdot who'd have to go to your web browser
    and type in google. com for a DOT edu. Yep. Right. There was they didn't do any
    advertising. There was no growth. They got. There is no growth hacking. They
    just had a website and they got millions and millions and millions of people to
    go out of their way, every day to open a web browser and go there.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Okay, and they have tens, if not hundreds of millions of daily active users.
    Now, They make something like half a billion dollars a day on the ads on their
    website. And again like if you think about them when they were startled zoom
    into that, they spent no money on user acquisition, they need to know Brandon,
    they didn't want no market and they just built a really good product that people
    really want it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Not only do the people wanted, like the people. Evangelized like my roommate in
    college, saw me, not using Google and like, scolded me and said, you're using
    the Bad search Into You Gotta use Google like that's way past like liking
    something, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It was obviously but and famously the ID, the product was so good. The founders
    didn't really want to run a start-up. They tried to sell the technology. Yes,
    they tried to get Yahoo to buy it, like the founders were disinterested in
    running a start-up but people wanted their products so badly that they got
    pulled into it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yes. Isn't that weird? And again this is the sign. This is the bar for Lot of
    these consumer ideas, is you make something that people are so obsessed with and
    is so high quality. You you don't have a choice basically, like he was a
    Founder, get pulled this direction that you weren't even sure you wanted to
    take.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That's a sign of like a pretty good consumer idea, okay? Like that's a pretty
    good bar. If we look at Google in historical context, is there? Another example,
    if you want to talk about here man? Like, you know, Facebook is extremely
    similar. You know, I believe this that was within 48 Hours of Facebook being
    released at Harvard 75% of the campus was using it and And when I think Peter
    teal and Reid Hoffman invested, the average time on site for user was two hours
    a day.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And so it's like holy crap and did they spend money on marketing and today, you
    know? Oh no. And I think that's what's crazy. Is that like often times people,
    don't communicate the truth about how these products actually started.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Like most people don't realize what they weren't there in the early days. They
    don't realize and you know you might hear some later stories about Facebook
    growth hacking and the Facebook growth team and all this other shit. Yeah that's
    not how Facebook started like people pulled the product. They were pissed when
    Facebook wasn't at the University and again, I think this is a lesson.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    What the bar is for Consumer. This is why we're telling you these stories is
    that the really iconic consumer companies, they tend to have in common Really
    excited users that use their product a lot. And the and the founders of these
    companies weren't like begging people to use them per say, they weren't paying a
    bunch of money and ads.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    They weren't like all those kinds of tactics weren't what they did. They just
    actually made Products that people became obsessed with very early on frankly.
    So, I think that is the first thing is this bar, let's talk about timing a
    little bit here because I think that you and I were fortunate enough to do
    startups during kind of too big.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Let's say kind of explosions of consumer products, right? Web 3, I'm sorry, web
    to it's a Freudian slip, web to and and mobile. And Why was it easier to make a
    consumer company in 2005, 2006, 2007 or a mobile company in 2010, 2011, 12, 13,
    14, what was happening in the 2000s, a lot of people had gotten broadband and
    they had gotten computers, and they were bored, and they're one if you if back
    in that era, you just launched something cool.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    People were bored and you're basically competing with television or something.
    And so again, when you think about when Facebook came out, they weren't
    competing with attention from a bunch of other social networks. They were
    competing with nothing, and so these college kids on the campuses back, then it
    was like crack, how addicted, people got to this thing and they would have
    people using a multiple hours a day.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Looking at everyone's photos leaving comments poking and liking. It was like so
    addictive. Because there was nothing remotely competing with those hours for the
    day. Well, it's interesting cuz like I'll put this in perspective. Like, you
    know, we are both in school during this period of time.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And like everyone would have a computer screen but at least in our dorm room,
    they'd only be one television, right? And so practically speaking, everyone was
    in front of their computer a lot more during that period of time. Of course,
    College gives great broadband and the big incumbents, the entertainment
    incumbents were all on TV.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So they were all battling each other on TV. And then, on the web, there weren't
    big incompetence. And you know, of course, my space was there, but my space was
    nowhere. Close to, as powerful as like, an NBC or CBS or Fox was on on
    television. So I think that was, like, a really big thing that people didn't
    realize is that the devices were there.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    All the harbor was there, all the connectivity was there, but the consumer
    products Weren't There Yet, bam. Perfect place. And let's be clear very similar
    in the smartphone. Game right? Very similar. Yeah, we all had smartphones and
    there was an app store and you at that era, if you were building mobile apps,
    right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    When the iPhone came out, you could have made some pretty basic stuff and got a
    lot of users. The bar was quite slow and historical perspectives because like,
    you know, people wanted to do stuff with their iPhone. Where's now and every app
    category, there's dozens of things, it's so right.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Like it's you had to be In the right time and right place for some of those
    ideas, right? So we've kind of talked all around it but let's let's kind of pin
    the tail here. Like what is a tar pit idea but let's really dig in. What are we
    talking about here? A tar pit idea is a consumer idea that many people try.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's an idea part of the reason. It's a tar pit and not just a hard idea is it
    has to feel sexy or you have to get lots of encouragement to work on it. You're
    likely to get positive feedback. Something about it. Will emotionally make you
    not want to Pivot away from it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Again this is kind of what's weird about why we use this term. Is, if you are
    not obstinately unwilling to quit working out, then it's not interpret. It's
    just a regular bandage. Is this a rare idea if you're not like? And so a true
    Tarpon is one that you will be defensive about when you are presented with
    evidence that the idea is challenging.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    You know, the funny thing is and I think you keep on saying it is that like
    these are not ideas where it appears like there's no hope. And sometimes ideas
    in these spaces work, right? Which is kind of the definition of like there's
    there's hope so I Think It's Tricky and I think what we're trying to say is that
    not don't build ideas in this space.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's just like going with both eyes open no, the game you're playing, you know
    like going with both eyes open no the bar. So one of them is An app to discover
    new things and new things could mean new restaurants, new events, New concerts,
    new bands, new videos.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's basically Discovery. And the pitch goes something like this. Discovery is
    broken. It's hard for me. Like, there's all these good restaurants that I don't
    know about and yes, Yelp exist in Google exists. But I want to hear new
    recommendations for my friends or I want to machine learning recommendations.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And I have this problem. I've talked to a bunch of people. I follow the YC
    advice on talking to my users and many people are telling me. They would love to
    find a better way to discover new restaurants or music or again all these things
    is very similar pitch so they would love to discover it and so we know people
    want it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So I have personal experience with this one and I think for the longest time, I
    agreed like, I was like, yes, this needs to exist. And as I got older I learned
    something that was slightly depressing. Thing, but is proven to be true. The
    magical place doesn't exist.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Right. Like there is a finite number of restaurants that are open tonight.
    That's it. And like you wanting there to be a better option, doesn't mean that a
    better option exists. And I mean, this is what's so tricky is that like the
    world seems Limitless, but for these physical things, it's actually fairly
    limited everyday people go on Yelp search the restaurants in their neighborhood.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Don't like what they find and are frustrated, but It doesn't mean that there are
    restaurants that don't, they don't know about that. Just means that what exists
    is not sufficient and ditto for parties, Dittos for events and concerts, and
    detonated on. And I think, you know, this is an honest, it's an honest mistake,
    right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's a very honest mistake because there is a problem. I don't like the
    restaurants in my neighborhood or my city, right? I've spent years of my life
    working on music discovery. And I understand the problems. One of the problems
    is that we think that the other users are like us and people like to say, they
    want to discover new music but in practice people like popular music from a
    small number of bands just like with restaurants.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Do you know what something we've learned from Jordache? Over the years is most
    people order like McDonald's and stuff like the average user comparable or the
    book from somewhere else. Some people like, they're not ordering like really,
    esoteric strange dish Is and and this is one of those things where I'm sure
    there's people.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    They're going to see this video and be like you're wrong. The thing with these
    ideas is it makes people emotional and it makes them want to debate or it makes
    them want to like something about it, makes you feel like the, you figured
    something out in the world is wrong and you have the vision, there's something
    weird about this and these Discovery start-up ideas really bring this out in
    Founders.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Again, we've been there, I've worked on this stuff, I get it. And so again,
    we're saying if you're working on Kind of stuff. We're interested in it, do a
    lot of research and understand that the reason those that came before you it's
    not that they're stupid. It's not that. They've never thought of this before.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's not that they haven't shipped anything before like, just realize, that's
    the tar pit talking. It's like, oh, this looks like a nice place. No one's no
    one's here, drinking at it. I'm going to, I'm going to go get a drink of water
    for this pool, right? Like no danger quicksand Dalton.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    I Must be the first person who have ever discovered this Papa. I just realized
    that Jin Z doesn't like Facebook very much. I just invented. This idea. No one
    has ever thought of this before. No one's ever have the bars hire, folks.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Here's some other recent kind of tar, pit ideas to share with people software to
    help people bet or gamble on things or things that people saw a lot of the
    GameStop, fun things with Wall Street bet. So, Options stock, trading stuffer,
    very active Traders.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    This is very common right now and again, maybe some of these ideas are good but
    I want folks to realize what a high percentage of all founders applying to, I
    see apply with these types of ideas. It's a very popular set of ideas and so you
    need the bars higher.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    If you're gonna be working in that kind of space, you can't just be like
    self-evidently people like to gamble. People like stock trading, but they don't
    like Robin Hood there for my startup will succeed. Like that is not a, that is
    not a compelling argument by itself.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Okay? Know for sure. Not. And I think that the probably the last thing is kind
    of in this world of web 3, right? And you've talked about this a lot. Web three
    opens up so many possibilities because it's the idea that everything could be
    rebuilt and like what couldn't be more exciting to a young founder coming into a
    world, would that?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That feels like everything's been built to be told. Oh no, everything is going
    to be rebuilt in this way. The challenge is like that's a very theoretical
    concept, right? Alton like yeah, how do you dig a little deep?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    You want to put that into practice and ideally you want to, ideally you have
    something deeper than and so therefore we're going to add tokens or therefore
    something something in ftes. Like the bar is higher. And again, speaking of in
    of T's remember, Open Sea. I interviewed those guys. I remember doing office
    hours with them, and what I will tell you is open sea, was not theoretical.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    They launched, they had users, they have graphs, they made money. It was like,
    actually something we could understand that made sense and wasn't all wishful
    thinking so you've got a theory about this whole game. So here's some share the
    fairy.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Here's a theory, I'd like to share with everybody. Like let's think about
    Founders and startups. Let's talk about supply and demand. And the argument is
    this, there's many start-up ideas that have very large supply of Founders that
    would want to work on them and there's some start-up ideas with a very low
    supply of Founders that want and not just want, have the skill set to work on
    them still with me.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So for instance, let's imagine the startup idea is one. Where is a consequence
    of being a Founder? You party with celebrities, and your job is to partner with
    these as possible. Yeah, I think the supply of Founders that are excited about
    that and again a lot of this is the music Discovery or the concert Discovery.
  ],

    If your startup idea is hey, I want to help people discover new concerts to go
    to is a consequence of working. That startup idea you're going to go to a lot of
    concerts, you have a lot of fun. Yay. And so there is a huge pool of people out
    in the universe that would love to work on a start-up idea. Okay. On the other
    side of the spectrum, the supply of Founders, that what what?

    To build open source developer, orchestration tools. Pretty low. And for and
    there's some people wear that stuff is great, like, right? It's just, it's not,
    you have to be technically, up, to be a programmer. Like, there's all these like
    boxes and filters. You have to pass through to think to yourself.

    I'm going to work on developer orchestration. You know, this is my passion. And
    so that's on the supply side, some ideas. A lot of people want to work on
    because it's cool and sexy and fun and hang out with cool people. Some of them,
    you know, how many people could start a Quantum Computing startup, what's the
    set of people in the universe?

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That could credibly start one of those Michael 20 people hundreds. Okay, yeah.
    Now, hundreds. Okay. So very small Supply. Now let's talk about the demand side.
    Yeah I go. What is the demand for a nun launched? Undifferentiated social app.
    Zero right thinking.

    How many apps launched on a lock in the App Store every day? Folks. Hundreds
    thousands, I don't know like most people don't search in the App Store for apps
    and launched that day to download them and try them out. People are busy, they
    don't care. And then and then I also have the demand side, what's the demand for
    high-quality software?

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That solves a major business problem. So that companies can run more efficiently
    in some industry. You really high like, think about again, you have to know what
    industry. Let's take your most expensive workers. Yeah, let's take your most
    expensive workers and make them fit.

    Eighty percent more productive. What are you thinking, like, retail? I guess
    would be example. That sounds like, oh, here's a no code tool to help help you.
    Let your non-technical people. Effectively be coders to build all these
    dashboards. What's the demand for a product? Like that infinite?

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yeah. People want it? Yeah, and so I think what you, yes, when we're talking
    about tar pit ideas, what were describing is ideas that have the largest
    oversupply of Founders that want to start them relative to Market? Demand. And I
    think you can think about this in terms of like being on the job market or
    something.

    If you don't really have differentiating skills from other candidates, it's just
    going to be harder than if you have really differentiated really special skills
    that stand out from the crowd. I think, what's interesting about this concept is
    how many founder how many potential Founders are sitting somewhere with
    expertise and they don't think the startup world is for them.

#transcript_bubble(

    You like, for example, we funded a mining software company, From, you know, this
    founder in Australia, who used to basically work for a mining company, building
    software to tell the coming like how to like to play all this really expensive
    equipment, not lose money.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And I think that there are probably hundreds of people like this founder, who
    would never think that the startup world is for them because they would think
    the startup world for people making stuff for creators or social networks or
    data tada, I think this is almost a plea to people who are experienced in, don't
    think their startup people, it's like you might be a start-up person.

    Like if you've solved an esoteric problem in a large industry or you have
    Insight on it you could be a start a person and solve that problem for the world
    like you might be, you might have a more unique perspective.

    I think startups are exclusively apps to discover restaurant again like this.
    No, there's too many of them. Don't know. And kind of like my ass on this, I
    think the best pivots are one of founding team recognizes these things of the
    supply and demand theory that I'm that I'm discussing and they find an idea.

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    With a lower supply of other people doing it and with larger demand from
    customers. And that when you move when you move from a lots of Supply Founders,
    low demand to low supply of other Founders high demand. That's a good pivot.

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    I would lights that's brags. That's retool. That's I mean we have so many
    examples of this stuff that's one framework I would have for. Describing what
    makes a great pivot is moving in a good direction on both of these vectors.
    Ours. Well in this might be torturing the metaphor, but basically what we're
    saying is instead of moving towards, what looks like the easy freshwater Pond
    but that's a trap.

    You move towards the mountains, the desert, right? The places that people don't
    want to go but you know, when people find gold, they usually don't find it in
    the middle of downtown Manhattan. You know, like usually have to go far away and
    so I think that those companies are really encouraging to work with and why see
    cuz you think to yourself, if you continue to walk that path away from the
    carpet, even if you start with a tarp but idea, Great.

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And, you know, honestly, we fun folks with carpet ideas because we have, we have
    the cathode that maybe they'll pivot out and many of them do which is kind of
    cool to watch look and closing folks out here. No, do your research know what
    the bar is think about the supply and demand thing and, you know, give yourself
    the bets, best odds for Success.

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    This is how you create luck. And so one of the reasons we want to put this there
    is, we would love Love to see more Founders kind of recognize this Dynamic,
    we're describing and make some moves on the supply and demand side because I
    think that'll meaningfully increase your odds of success. Just think on that and
    take it from us because we can't tell you what the play to win is but like, we
    think it's our responsibility to tell you the plays that we see losing all the
    time, you know?

    And, and if you can avoid the most common patterns of death, you can perhaps
    chart a unique path, To success. And that's if any advisor tells you, they can
    do more for you than that, be wary. All right, Dalton, great chat, thanks.
