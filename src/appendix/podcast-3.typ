    You're offering adventure, you're offering the unknown and. Adventure isn't
    Here's my idea for a social network for dogs. Will you build my website? No.
    Let's build a company together. Yes. Welcome to Dalton Post, Michael.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Today we're going to talk about why business folks need great Technical Co
    founders. So who's this video for? Let's talk about the business folks who we're
    talking to. Yeah, I think to set this up, Michael and I both talked to a lot of
    aspiring founders in any number of different venues on the street, at
    conferences, interviews, wherever, like they find us, they find us.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And one of the more common opening lines is something like, well, I'm a really
    good business person. A great idea. I have the best ideas, you know. How do I
    need a technical Co founder? Or how do I find a technical Co founder?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Or I can't find any good technical Co founders. Like this is one of the number
    one opening questions we get when we meet people in the real world. Yes. And so
    this video is aimed at all of those people that ask all these questions that we
    have met and all the people that haven't met us that might be thinking these
    questions.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And what we want to do is give you the key secret to actually being the best
    business Co founder. And we're not going to hide it, we're going to put it right
    up front. The best business founders recruit amazing technical Co founders and
    that is how they distinguish themselves.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That is the number one distinction. So it's not what's on your resume where you
    worked, the fact that you were some fancy executive, that you're tall people
    like to go and have drinks with you. You've got amazing ideas. Unfortunately,
    there are a lot of folks like that.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yeah. Imagine the set of people. Imagine the intersection. There's the set of
    people that are great business founders, and there's the set of people that can
    recruit amazing technical Co founders. You want to be in the intersection of
    those two sets, and there's not many people.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    That puts you in a very special class. Well, and I would, I would argue it is so
    distinguishing that you're given amazing opportunities. But what's tricky is not
    only do people not see this, or do people try and not get a techno.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Finder. Or they just dismiss it out of hand. It's too hard. Like, they'll just
    kind of, like, shut this. That's what's even more common. It's just that like,
    well, I I can't find this person, so I don't. Know anyone? Yeah, I don't know.
    Anyone. OK, You know. And this is the crazy thing, because like a lot of people
    will pitch this to me like, but this is the true spirit of an
    entrepreneurialism, like no barrier can prevent me from getting my product to
    market right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Like I couldn't find technical Co founder, so I just moved to the next
    challenge. I hired some engineers or I got a dev shop and like nothing will keep
    me, will hold me back. And what's so sad about that way of thinking about it is
    that like, one, the percentage chances of death just went through the roof,
    right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Like you've just completely reduced your chances of success. But two? I bet if
    you would put the same amount of effort you put into getting a product to market
    without a great technical founder into finding a great technical founder, at
    least half people would be able to do it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yeah. And so it's just like, it's a shame because it's so much wasted talent.
    Yeah, I I don't like to think about it this way. Again, we are what we're
    talking about implicitly. Let's make it explicit. We're talking about a company
    that uses software as a deep part of it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So. If we're talking about a software startup and you somehow don't have a
    technical Co founder, this would be like I'm gonna build a rocket to the moon.
    But no one here knows anything about physics. We can my I have such a big heart.
    We can just like. Like I have.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Such hustle. I'm Johnny Hustle. I'm going to the moon, Michael. Like, do you see
    how absurd that is? And the asterisk is OK. If you want to start a new clothing
    brand or a liquor brand, OK, you don't need to do it. Do it. Do it. This doesn't
    apply. Obviously. But if you're saying yeah I'm gonna build a software company
    and you don't have a software Co founder, it just you're not even in the ball
    game.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    You're not even in the stadium. One, what's so sad for me is like when I say
    that to people, sometimes they think I'm trying to discourage them. But if you.
    Go back to like I'm gonna prove you wrong, Michael. Yeah. I'm gonna learn
    physics. Yeah. And I'm like I am not trying to like, I am trying to tell you the
    number or like I came to you for advice about my product but you're telling me I
    need a code.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    You're insulting me. Michael Yeah, yeah. And it's just like, no, I'm trying to
    give you the most important thing I can tell you. And you know, what was
    interesting is that, like, this is advice is informed by my personal experience,
    right. Like I was the single non-technical person on a four person Co finding
    team at Justin TV and Twitch.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And like I'll just make it plain without my three other Co founders none of that
    shit happens. Like ideas are a dime a dozen. And so I think that more business
    people need to embrace the idea that great software companies are built by great
    software engineers.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yep. A common retort out here is like Dalton, we're not building a software
    business. Software is in there, but it's not. That it's a tech enabled. Yeah,
    we're just building a simple marketplace, right? Like we can just use dedited
    marketplace software. It's just a copy of DoorDash with a little twist.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Why do we need a great software engineer? What's your response? You know, it's
    hard to win that debate in theory. Like, it's hard to convince someone just in
    the debate. They'll be like, well, we're just going to agree to disagree, yes.
    But I think if you just look at the facts of the companies we funded like
    literally DoorDash or literally Airbnb or any of these folks, they lived and
    died by their speed of shipping software.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And if they what they did was buy white label software or have some dev shop in
    a foreign country making edits to the website, there's a 0% chance those
    companies would have worked.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And so again, who am I to say there won't be some future company that maybe uses
    one of these things, But the more that the more that we're exposed to seeing
    what these companies look like at the earliest stages, even if they don't look
    like strictly tech businesses.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Man, there's no way these things would have gotten off the ground without having
    a really great person who cared as much as a Co founder cares building this
    thing day in and day out versus someone ripping you off, charging you 500
    dollars an hour to change some words on the website.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And you don't even know. That's not you're not even in the right ball game. Like
    it's not even. Well what what pisses me off is that like I think in other areas
    that are equally as hard as being successful tech founder, let's say athletics,
    I think more people are realistic about it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Strangely, like the equivalent is, you know, A5 foot four person who doesn't
    jump. I can't. Shoot, yeah. Can't run. Yeah. And they've got a lot of heart
    mangles. Yeah, they're not that many of those people who are saying that the
    world do I wanna be in the NBA, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Whereas we see the equivalent of that in startups all the time. And it's like,
    it's one thing if you're 6/6 and like you're like a great high school basketball
    player, you probably won't make the NBA. But, like, all right, at least. You,
    you're in the stadium. In the stadium, you're amongst the million people who
    could.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yeah. And I think that people are not honest with themselves. And I think what
    we're trying to do is give you the secret, which is that like, you can almost
    get a ticket to being in the game and it requires recruiting one person. Yep.
    How cool is that?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Like, this shouldn't be seen as a negative. It seems like an extreme positive.
    It's like a golden. What is it, Willy Wonka? Ticket and and even if you are
    technical yourself or sometimes people are medium technical like so I I was a
    technical CEO but I still tremendously benefited by having an additional
    technical Co founder and so this is also a thing where you're not like OK well I
    you know I.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    I can kind. Of I can kind of like. OK, that doesn't count. There's actually
    tremendous benefits from having someone again who cares as much as a founder
    who's committed as much as a founder and who's at, you know, at the top of the
    game. Like a 10X engineer on a founder level, you're unstoppable.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And what's weird is sometimes we had competitors in in my startups whose teams
    were constructed this way, horrible tech talent. And it was funny in hindsight,
    because we never had to be worried. They could raise more money. They could have
    nicer office, They could have more employees.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    They could have cooler people using their did it matter? Like having better,
    engineering is the gift that gives you more shot. Even if you need to pivot, no
    matter what, no matter what happens, good or bad, you're.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    In a better. You're in a better position to react to these changes. Yes. And I
    think the even scarier thing about this is that, like when you start with a team
    of business people assessing engineers, and they are naturally gonna start by
    hiring worse engineers, all of your future engineers.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Compounding by. The people. Yeah, exactly. It compounds. So OK. So, all right,
    Michael. All right. You guys convinced me, I guess. Whatever. But I don't, you
    know, sure, sure. This guy, you know, I guess that's a point you can make. I
    don't know. But Michael, I don't know.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Anyone. Where do I find these people? Yeah, how? Again, that's what we always
    say in these. Conversations. That's what they always. Say so how? What is your
    response when they tell you? That So the first thing is that, like, who are you
    disqualifying and why? I can't tell you how many business people told me, well,
    I obviously need a CTO with 10 years of experience and who've managed teams of
    at least 50 to 100.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And I'm like, you're 23 years old with no years of experience. Why do you need
    that? And they're like, well, because, you know, when we launch, this thing's
    going to get big. And it's like, come on. So first, you might be disqualifying.
    Great people don't do that.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And so let's say you don't know them. Sometimes the number one thing to do if
    you're in this position is to not start the company right now is to go get a job
    at a startup, is to go change the people you know. And what's so interesting is
    that, like sometimes, taking that step sideways is the easiest and best path to
    starting set up journey with the highest leghood of success well.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Here's the thought experiment I encourage people to do. Visualize the best
    person you have ever worked with, either in school or in your job. The best
    engineer that everyone knows is the best person. Can you visualize someone? OK,
    can you get that person to be your Co founder?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And often people are like, Oh yeah, no, they would never they would never work
    with me. What do you mean, man? Or like they're making lots of money. And again,
    I would just stop right there and be like, well, why have you talked to them?
    And they're like, no, they would just like basically folks put up the barriers
    to negotiate against themselves right out of the gate.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And again, if we zoom all the way out, So you want to start a company, You want
    to do something big, but you won't actually even bother to try to recruit the
    most obvious person. That's a candidate that you know. But what if they say no?
    Or you talk to them and they're like, no, I don't think so.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    What often happens, again, to go deep on this, is that the way they'll pitch the
    person is they'll pitch them their idea. They'll be like, I'm an idea guy, I've
    got a great idea. Do you want to be my, like, worker bee, to go do all my ideas?
    And of course, the person that's the best person you've ever worked with does
    not want to sit in a cage.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    No. And do all of the work that you give them and instead I'm like, well have
    you asked them what if they have startup ideas And then you sell yourself where
    you can come together, come up with the idea together as Co owners. And it's
    shocking how often that appears to have never occurred to someone like they
    think the idea of finding a technical Co founder is to find someone who will
    basically submit to their whims and be like their like assistant.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    To find an employee, yeah. And that's not the move, man trying. To find a
    partner. You know, it's funny, 'cause my dad would say this to me about my Co
    founder Justin Kahn. He was like, you know, Michael, Justin's an amazing
    recruiter. And I always thought I was like, what's weird is like, I think if
    you're recruited by a good recruiter, you don't even realize they're a good
    recruiter, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    But like, in hindsight, I'm like, all right, so we got me, Emmett and Kyle to
    work for him. Well, not work for him but to be his Co founders in a start up
    where he was wearing a camera on his side streaming his live 24/7. Named after
    him. Yes, named justin. tv.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Do you want to work out my start up? Yes, it's me and. And and he had raised 50
    thousand of dollars. Seems like a great deal. Like, yeah, right. And so it's
    like, OK, well, like, how did he build that team? Like, you know, it comes back
    to, like, you want to distinguish yourself as a business person.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Go do that. Like people? Should be impressed. When you're impressed. Why? You're
    a great business, Sir. And hey, they're working on your idea. That's. Even when
    I promise you might be like. No idea. Well, I'll you know.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    I'll tell you what he promised you. It wasn't that The idea was going to work
    like it was the adventure. OK. It was the adventure. And like, I think what's so
    interesting when people like, don't ask their friend and they assume, oh, but
    they work at this company, they're never gonna do it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Da da da. It's like they don't realize you're offering adventure. You're
    offering the unknown. And adventure isn't Here's my idea for a social network
    for dogs. Will you build my website? Let's build a company. Together. Yes,
    that's adventure.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    Yes, and what's crazy is like when you're pitching adventure. There aren't a lot
    of there aren't a lot of alternatives. Most people don't have six adventures on
    the plane. How often does any one person get pitched adventure? No. It's usually
    adventure or like, so, you know, it's a good pitch.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    It's a good pitch. So anyways, right, I think that we're trying, you know, I
    think that there's, like, I'll say this, I'm a business guy, right? I think YC
    has a lot of messaging. That's like, yeah, our business guy's important. Da, da,
    da, da. Like, you don't need them. I agree. You don't need them. But I will say
    this, there are a lot of very successful non-technical people in our network
    that do amazing work.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    And I think one of the things that if you want to learn from them, we're trying
    to give you one of the most important patterns we see from those folks. Yeah,
    they're great recruiters and they they do this thought experiment of who's the
    best person in the world and they find a way to get that person to work with
    them that's bending the universe to your will, is what that is.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [??:??], [
    So you should hold yourself to their standard and maybe you'll get their
    success. All right. Thanks, Dalton. Thanks.
