== Example Feedback Prompt <example-feedback-prompt>

To query the AI to give my feedback on this assignment I used the following
prompt:

#block(

```Markdown
  Attached: first-draft-of-the-assignment.pdf

  Please grade my submission as harshly as you can according to the rubric below.

  - List all things the rubric says I need to do that I did not do.
  - List all things that I did that I should not have done.
  - List all things I've done, but not up to the maximum grading.

  | **Criteria** | **Full marks (7.1–10 pts)** | **Sufficient (5.1–7 pts)** | **Insufficient (0–5 pts)** |
  | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Completeness** | All slides and tests are completed. Questions are addressed with good detail and specification. | All slides and tests are completed. Questions are properly addressed and demonstrate participation of student in both workshops and guest lectures. | Not all slides are completed. Questions are not (all) addressed. The reflection demonstrates student did not sufficiently participate in workshops and guest lectures. |
  | **Level of reflection** | Both strengths and weaknesses are mentioned for all competences. Student is able to translate strengths and weaknesses into tangible learnings for the future. | Both strengths and weaknesses are mentioned for most competences. The link between strengths and weaknesses and learning for the future are vague. | Reflection mainly highlights strengths or weaknesses. No learnings for the future are mentioned. Lessons learned are not competence specific. |
  | **Personal development** | Choice for type of entrepreneurship and competence development is clearly motivated by tests and learnings from workshops and guest lectures. | A clear choice for type of entrepreneurship and competence development. Choices do not relate clearly to insights obtained from tests and lessons from workshops and guest lectures. | A clear choice regarding type of entrepreneurship and competence development is missing. |

  # Completeness

  ## What’s missing / insufficient

  - No explicit evidence that you attended or reflected on guest lectures or
    workshops — only “tutorials” are mentioned.
  - Reflection doesn’t clearly address all required questions at high detail; some
    sections (e.g., “Dealing with Uncertainty”) are brief and lack depth.
  - You mention “tests” (like personality/entrepreneurship ones) only in your AI
    section, not in the reflection or personal development plan, though rubric
    expects you to connect test results to choices.
  - No indication of using all required ideation tools; only “personas” and
    “brainstorming” are discussed.
  - Some sections read more as descriptions of events than reflective analysis
    (e.g., section 3.1).

  ## What you did that you shouldn’t have

  - You sometimes included storytelling or personal anecdotes (friend hit by a bus)
    that, while heartfelt, don’t count as “detailed specification” of the
    entrepreneurship challenge.
  - The “AI disclosure” section takes space but adds nothing toward rubric criteria.

  ## Partial credit possible

  - You did fill all required sections; no missing slides/sections.
  - The prototype and Arduino appendix go beyond expectations (good detail).

  ## Verdict

  Sufficient (6.5/10) — lacks workshop/guest lecture reflection and test integration.

  # Level of Reflection

  ## What’s missing / insufficient

  - Strengths and weaknesses are mentioned in general terms (e.g., you “talk too
    fast,” you “struggle to validate ideas”) but not systematically across all
    competences.
  - Future learnings are there (SMART goals), but not tied to the specific
    weaknesses or to competences clearly.
  - No meta-reflection on teamwork, collaboration, or entrepreneurial competences
    (creativity, resilience, opportunity recognition, etc.).
  - No mention of how feedback changed your perspective beyond presentation speed.

  ## What you did that you shouldn’t have

  - You sometimes justified instead of reflecting (“I think I could do that all
    myself”) — less self-critical.
  - Reflection tone is descriptive rather than analytical in several parts.

  ## Partial credit possible

  - You do identify personal weaknesses and learning goals (validation, value
    capture understanding).
  - SMART structure is solid — that saves this category from “insufficient.”

  ## Verdict

  Sufficient (6.8/10) — reflection exists but lacks depth and full
  competence coverage.

  # Personal Development

  ## What’s missing / insufficient

  - You don’t clearly link your entrepreneurial “type” or chosen competences to test
    results or workshops. The rubric requires this explicit link.
  - The personal development plan focuses mainly on general software development
    improvement, not entrepreneurship mindset or competence growth.
  - No motivation or reasoning for “type of entrepreneurship” (e.g., social, tech,
    sustainable, etc.) — required by rubric.
  - SMART goals are good but generic and not grounded in course content (no mention
    of “what I learned in guest lecture X helped me decide to focus on Y”).

  ## What you did that you shouldn’t have

  - Overly technical goals (“Arduino prototype,” “presentation builder”) stray from
    personal competence development.

  ## Partial credit possible

  - You have clearly structured SMART goals and corresponding activities — good
    organization.

  ## Verdict

  Low Sufficient (5.8/10) — well-structured goals but missing
  connection to course insights and entrepreneurship type.

  ---

  Overall Estimated Grade: ≈ 6.3 / 10

  You meet the “sufficient” criteria across the board but don’t reach the “full
  marks” range due to:

  - missing guest lecture/workshop integration,
  - lack of explicit link between test results and goals,
  - surface-level reflection on competences,
  - minimal connection between course content and your future learning.
