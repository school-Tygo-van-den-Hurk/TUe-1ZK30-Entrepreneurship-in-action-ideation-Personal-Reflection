  [00:00], [
    In all three of these cases, these folks had the problem they had experience.
    And in hindsight, there was an obvious opportunity to make something 10x better,
    but most people thought they were idiots and that's probably the overarching
    theme, they had to be contrarian.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [00:17], [
    Hey, this is Michael Seibel with Dalton Caldwell. Today, we're going to talk
    about where do great start-up ideas. Come from we picked three successful YC
    companies. From fact this question Airbnb. Coinbase and stripe. And there are
    three common themes that we've seen through all three of these companies.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [00:34], [
    The first timing was important for each of these companies, there is a
    pre-existing product, pre-existing competitor, dominant you might say, but there
    was an opportunity to make something that was 10x better than what existed.
    Number two, most people Founders, and investors thought these ideas were
    horrible either because they were too hard to execute or because they just were
    bad ideas.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [00:59], [
    And then number three and I think the coolest one of them is that each of these
    opportunities turned out to be bigger than the founders, even knew when they
    started, they turned out to be way bigger. All right, so let's talk about
    Airbnb. One of the things that I think is really interesting to set this up is
    that existing products did exist?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [01:21], [
    Right Airbnb. Did not come up with this idea. So what were you using before?
    Airbnb to Airbnb dolphin. Yeah. Context. I think if you, if you've only seen
    Airbnb, you think they came up with the idea, that's probably if I talk to my
    mom, she said, oh, airbnb's a great idea that those Founders dreamed up, but
    back in the day, I was already using VRBO before.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [01:44], [
    Air B&B was even funded by YC or existed. There was also a very popular startup
    called Couchsurfing which was quite similar to Air B&B and it had a lot of
    mindshare had a lot of was a big Network and so it kind of felt like The Third
    Rate entrant to a crowded space at the time.

  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [02:04], [
    I remember when they're into, I see that was my perspective. Do you remember
    that Michael? How do you use any of those? Because I use VRBO personally and I
    thought I'd hate to use to VRBO. I had also use Couchsurfing, one of the reasons
    why I was actually excited about working with the Air BnB folks was because
    using Couchsurfing was so painful and so I think that you know, first thing,
    when it comes to timing, I think they now this hardcore, they weren't first But
    the existing products weren't great.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [02:32], [
    And I think it's interesting to talk about why the existing products weren't
    great because honestly, that's important. I would argue that, like, there were
    two fundamental facts that made the existing products, not good. The first is
    that VRBO?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [02:49], [
    And Craigslist did not facilitate payments. So when you arranged in a house
    share with someone or staying in someone's apartment, you still had to pay them
    either in cash or check. A wire and there was a lot of friction because there's
    two people who don't know each other having to trust each other to transmit
    payments.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [03:08], [
    I think the second problem that VRBO had was they charge hosts to list and if
    you think about the core inside of this Market, it's that hosts are the game. If
    you can get the most hosts, you win, you have the best inventory, but if you
    charge them, run to be on your site, like you're probably doing it wrong.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [03:28], [
    So to me, Me timing was huge, existing product, did not. There were 10 x
    improvements that can be made. And the second thing that was really interesting
    was that they were solving their own problem. Like, most people don't realize
    that Airbnb started because Joe and Nee needed to make rent money.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [03:50], [
    And there was a big conference going on in San Francisco, and they basically
    rent it out Froome on the floor to host people so that they could make some
    money. It's funny because we always talk about personal problems, but like not
    being able to pay rent. That's like that's a real problem, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [04:08], [
    And that doesn't sound like a vacation rental, which was what I was used to
    seeing on VRBO which was vacation rentals the exactly. Exactly. I think it was
    interesting at the time that a lot of people realize that they could use their
    property, make extra money, and it's not a coincidence that this happened around
    the same time as the o, a crash, where a lot of people needed to make.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [04:30], [
    Make an extra buck and suddenly they realize, oh, I have an asset right now. I
    can make some money on then. I think the last thing is they used their own
    product Airbnb, didn't realize the Insight around, facilitating payments around
    accepting payment.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [04:45], [
    When they launched. They didn't have it inside when they launched, Brian came
    and spoke to YC recently. And he shared the story that when he used his own
    product, and he forgot to bring money for payment and the host thought he was a
    fraud. He realized, oh crap. Like Site needs to allow people to pay like we have
    to solve this problem.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [05:04], [
    So it's funny because these insights seems obvious now. But Dalton back in the
    day, you know, put your investor hat on, what were the shit takes? Like why did
    everyone think this is a dumb? This is dumb, you should almost there's two
    extremes. One was renting a house when someone is already home renting, a room
    in a house with a Hoster, there was like the ultimate unappealing scary.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [05:28], [
    Bad thing that no one Want to do especially older, folks, you know, Yak investor
    folks for like investor types. You know, a lot of money and can afford nice
    hotels. So it was extremely unappealing idea of people worried about those sorts
    of things and then like the other the other Insight I have for you on this one
    is it was seen as uncool and In pure, when you're building the community at this
    time in history to charge money for it, like the couch surfing, ethos was it was
    a very like communal community-based.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [06:13], [
    Pay It Forward, social Collective action, decentralized, goodness thing and to
    be commercial was extremely important a stand. Remember, Michael, you and I both
    were the founders in this era, all Of the messaging that was bombarded from us
    from everyone.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [06:32], [
    All of our peers is that making money isn't cool, and being commercialism cool.
    And what they should have done is get as big as they could and get 100 million
    people on your B&B and then charge once they built the network and sort of
    charge. That's a horrible idea, guys.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [06:49], [
    Build the network first and then charge. Right? Like again, you went through
    this as a Founder man. Isn't this? What on Earth you would have been told? It's
    where we were told. I mean twitch became big. When we start diversifying our
    business model and it start accepting direct payments from users, in addition to
    ads, but that was seen as dumb back then.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [07:10], [
    So clearly and of course, is going to be a common theme. If they had listened to
    most of the investors or most of the founders at the time Airbnb wouldn't exist.
    Yeah, I'd be like will capture if it is free. So your plan is to build something
    like Couchsurfing. But with no users and you're just starting and you're going
    to charge money for it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [07:29], [
    Good luck. That sounds like a suicide mission, right? All right, so the next one
    is coinbase, so set the scene for coin. Basic, what do you think, Brian saw,
    when he was getting rolling? What was the? So I was around back then, and I was
    trying to buy Bitcoin back then too.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [07:48], [
    And I remember the coinbase YC application really well on the whole historical
    context. So to set this up for people, Circa 2011 and 2012, it was really hard
    to buy Bitcoin. Really hard? I remember looking into it around 2011 and there
    was a step of sending money orders like going to Western Union and sending him
    money order to some foreign country and that's when I opt out of it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [08:13], [
    I wish I would have done it when I make a lot of money but I didn't because it
    just seemed too much like a total scam. Like if you ever see any money orders to
    foreign countries, something is going wrong in your life, right? But anyway, I
    also was familiar with mountain Cox and mount gox was a, was the biggest and
    largest Bitcoin exchange back in the day.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [08:32], [
    And it went down a lot and got hacked, and everyone lost all their money. I
    actually lost some money. Macaques personally, I think I had about one Bitcoin
    in Mount gox. I'm not too worried about it. I feel like the reputation among Cox
    was like, you can get money in but you can't ever get any money back out.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [08:50], [
    Of that was the environment where killed. According what is clear? Is that Knox
    was an acronym. That was magic, the Gathering on like a online exchange was
    originally a website to trade magic cards that they pivoted into into Bitcoin.
    And so anyway, the historical Insight was buying Bitcoin was something people
    wanted to do, but all of the options were pretty bad.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [09:12], [
    That's a historical context and Bryan wanted to fix that. I think what's really
    interesting about this is we come back towards he wasn't the first mover was not
    the first mover but the product that existed was so bad that a 10x better
    product was actually Within Reach.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [09:30], [
    Like it was actually possible. I think the other fun Insight here is that like
    portable online. Gold is valuable. Like it is 10x better than gold. And so as
    something you might want to have, if you think gold is Something that you might
    want to own and seems like the market does like owning gold portable online.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [09:51], [
    Gold strictly better. So I think Out of maybe all three of these Founders Brian
    was exposed to the most shit takes the most people saying this was not going to
    work. So break that down first.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [10:06], [
    Like, explain all the reasons why coinbase is not supposed to work and Brian
    should not be successful founder today. Well, at the time, people saw Bitcoin as
    a tiny Market that it was going to crash that it was a bubble. Investor didn't
    like it. It was synonymous with a lot of, you know, actual fraud, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [10:24], [
    Didn't didn't have a great reputation. Action also getting a bank deal with
    impossible. It's not like other Founders. Didn't want to start something like
    coinbase us. Based exchanges were incredibly hard to start and this is a reason
    why all the exchanges at the time, where offshore was the regulatory
    environments? Were were different in different places, right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [10:43], [
    Another thing I want to know is even Brian and is why C application didn't
    really believe in his own idea because what he basically applied to y c with was
    the PDP transfer of parts. It wasn't buying Bitcoin and holding it. It was the
    idea that you could build something like PayPal to do p transfers and that the
    the buy Bitcoin part, but that was just part of it.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [11:06], [
    And so isn't it funny that even he kind of undercounted the the symbol promise
    of buying Bitcoin in a non sketchy way with a debit card in the US and not
    getting hacked and losing all your money. That was a nut. That was enough of an
    insight to be the basis for like a hundred billion dollar company.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [11:24], [
    He didn't need to do all this other stuff. But he knows he appointed and, and,
    and following the pattern of valuable Insight that he learns after starting the
    company, right? Like, you don't have to have all the valuable insights before
    you start. But you remember what the coin based product was back in the day,
    right?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [11:42], [
    It was a website. You logged in. You put in how much Bitcoin you wanted to buy
    and you push the button and you bought it and not that was, you could sell out
    to there was no, there was no social network. There was no comment feet, you
    know, it was only due to see the simplest products graphs.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [12:01], [
    It was one of the simplest products I've ever seen. Yeah, but it's because it's
    all of the rights of single problem at the time. And I think that the way that
    this is kind of embodied was that fully embodied. How bad of an idea people
    thought this was is that he had an impossible time raising money on demo day.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [12:01], [
    And so if he had taken the demo day signal that investors signal of oh we don't
    want to give you money and quit. We're going to coinbase, correct. All right.
    Last one stripe. So you had dabbled with payments pre stripe.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [12:39], [
    How easy was it to accept credit cards online? Pre stripe. Tell ya. Share my
    story with that. I have set up before. Stripe existed. I set up accepting credit
    cards for for my company's twice once in 2002 or so, believe it or not, when I
    was very young and then once again in 2007 and to get a merchant credit card
    account was like applying for a mortgage, you had to fill out lots of paper, you
    had to fax in In stuff you had to personally guarantee things they had to do
    fraud checks on you it was rough.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [13:14], [
    It was expensive. There was minimums and it was so as a possible thing to do but
    I would call it gnarly and the opposite of easy and every way. Okay, and so that
    was so and I also remember when strike came out, I was actually in the Striped
    bin. I was one of the first 100 customers, who strike way back in the day before
    my cup for my third company.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [13:33], [
    The third time I want to accept credit cards and I really wanted it in terms of
    make something people want when it came out and I read about on a hacker news, I
    immediately wanted strike and I haven't even seen it yet. I just knew I wanted
    it so that massive historical context.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [13:50], [
    You know, it's funny, we were authorize. net users to at Justin TV and twitch
    and perfect example. Again of like a taste of the good stuff which so hard to
    you, it took us three months to start accepting credit cards.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [14:07], [
    I think there was a 30-page contract that we had to read and figure out a sign
    and it was like, wow. So once again, not first mover, I think another really
    interesting thing about stripe was that it was a problem that they saw their
    peers in YC have. So literally they were seeing all of their friends and YC not
    going through all of the pain of authorize. net and they're hearing the story
    over and over again and let me know that's a good hint for people out there
    looking for idea.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [14:33], [
    It's like if all of your smart technical friends are complaining about the
    Thing, maybe it's a real problem. Now, last Insight that I think that they had
    talked to me about their go to market and specifically about understanding that
    their customers were developers and not business, guys, because I think that was
    revolutionary at the time.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [14:56], [
    Yeah, the the really clever Brand promise or marketing, stands, or whatever you
    want to call it, they had was to try to make the most beautiful website they
    could with the most beautiful documentation that was every, you know,
    programmers dream.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [15:15], [
    Like they constantly ask themself and push themselves to say, what would I want,
    or what would it be? What would a programmer want? And this is so different than
    every other Processing Company because it was built for basically business.
    People like the customer was not the The programmer who had to implement
    authorize. net was not the customer.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [15:33], [
    It was like some someone getting paid, you know, 20 bucks an hour or something
    to implement the code. Whereas this was like, they went nuts, it making
    something that developers would just freak out about and everyone copied it. By
    the way, every developer would copy, the stripe documentation, copy the stripe
    website.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [15:51], [
    It was like the Apple. It was like a Steve Jobs had to design a payments
    company. It would be stripe. And I think it totally do this on purpose, but what
    this created is a lot of buzz on Hacker News and around nerds.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [16:07], [
    Basically that, hey, have you seen this type thing? Oh, are you in the band
    also? They had did a beta invite program, and so there was a, it was a hot
    commodity to be able to get into striking, be able to use it, you were seen as
    well connected. If you got the pleasure of getting to use stripe, it was like a
    favor, they were doing you, delete user product.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [16:26], [
    That's how that's how that's what a great job they did and making the Any
    documentation, excellent. What I love is that when the sky Founders came to
    speak at YC, the other detail they added was it was the most expensive product
    in the market like to make sure people really wanted it, didn't give it away for
    free.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [16:45], [
    They didn't price a comparably. They made it more expensive and people were
    still desperate to use it. Like, that's how, you know, you have an Insight like
    when you're the most expensive thing, speaking of apple and people still are
    desperate for it. Now the shit takes, right? This should takes for pretty clear.
    One, what are two teenagers doing in the banking space?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [17:03], [
    The right government regulations, the most regulated space in the fucking world,
    right? It is like a suicide mission, you like, hi, we're 19. We want to start
    basically a bank. Give us all your money. Like we're going to, we're going to,
    we're going to handle hundreds of millions of dollars of everyone's money.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [17:18], [
    So yeah, that's our plan. And there will be no fraud. Like we're good. I think
    the second one is that even subtracting regulation. They needed a bank deal,
    they needed Wells. Go to let them start using the rails. What? Like, as an early
    stage startup, they need to get that which at the time seemed impossible.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [17:38], [
    And then, of course, hitting the last one, is that, like, PayPal existed there
    was a really popular company where it felt like PayPal was like a quarter step
    away from this, right? And I was like, oh, even if you start doing well, PayPal
    can go here instantly.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [17:54], [
    They've all these users. They're the hot company. Yeah, it was seen as a
    crowded. It with huge companies with hundreds of employees, thousands of
    employees. It's the class that thing again, the knock against YC companies, in
    the time is, why see what just fund, crappy versions of existing company, like
    the third-rate knockoff version of something?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [18:13], [
    Actually. Good was what YC companies were is that hilarious? I don't know if
    people remember that, but that was the reputation of YC companies is like, oh
    yeah, they'll take an existing idea that's good and they'll make like a less
    popular version of it. Which which kills me?
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [18:29], [
    Because like in all three of these cases, these folks had the problem they had
    experience. And in hindsight, there was an obvious opportunity to make something
    10x better. But most people thought they were idiots and that's probably the
    overarching theme.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [18:45], [
    They had to be contrarian to walk down this path because if they had asked 10
    startup experts, 10 investors, 10, fellow Founders, eight of them would tell
    them that they were stupid. And like they had to seal good products like you
    can't take for granted, you can't, we can't, you know, talk on a whiteboard and
    plan our strategy and when all of these Founders had to actually do it and the
    doing it part was the hard part.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [19:13], [
    Yes. Right. Like all these people had to execute and build a product that people
    love and actually worked in. All these people built products that handled
    hundreds of millions of dollars and they couldn't lose the money, right? So the
    actual execution, B talk is cheap. is hard, excuse you expensive, they had all
    these folks, how to execute So I think what the takeaway here is, if we can sum
    this up one, you shouldn't give a shit if there's an existing product in the
    market.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [19:40], [
    If you're a user of that product or your friends are users of that product and
    they all hate it, and you should not give a shit. To you should not give a shit.
    If most of the people around you who you believe our experts, don't think this
    is a good idea especially you shouldn't care if they're not going to be users.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [20:01], [
    If they have no experience with the pain of using the existing product. And then
    three. Be very careful about your initial Market math. Be very careful about
    pretending that you know how big the market could be.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [20:17], [
    It turns out with so many of these transformational Technologies their use
    cases, you can't and dream of that. Once you build a 10x better product, other
    people will do and so each and every time these Founders were presenting oh we
    have a market size of blank. The next time they raised money they could say.
  ],
)

#transcript_bubble(
  [20:34], [
    Actually we made a mistake, the market size is actually bigger. We didn't think
    of this, we didn't think of that, and so don't be discouraged. If someone's
    like, that's a tiny Market. That's kind of a bullshit thing that would have
    killed all these companies. All right, talk to you later, man.
  ],
)
